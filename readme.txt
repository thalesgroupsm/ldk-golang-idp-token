To enable a user to log in once and be authenticated across two different Identity Providers (IdPs), you can set up a Single Sign-On (SSO) system with multi-IdP integration. Here’s how you can approach this:
1. Choose a Primary IdP and Support Federation

    Select one IdP as the primary or "home" IdP, where users log in initially.
    Enable the primary IdP to support federation or authentication delegation to the second IdP.
    Many modern IdPs like Okta, Auth0, and Azure AD support multi-IdP configurations and can act as a proxy to authenticate users from multiple sources.

2. Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML for Federation

    Both OIDC and SAML allow for federated authentication across multiple IdPs.
    Configure the primary IdP to accept authentication tokens from the secondary IdP.
    Users authenticate once with the primary IdP, which then issues an authentication token valid for both IdPs.

3. Use a Centralized SSO Solution

    Implement a centralized SSO service like a custom-built gateway or a third-party solution (e.g., Okta, Ping Identity) that can integrate with multiple IdPs.
    The centralized SSO platform handles the initial user login and maintains the session, generating tokens valid for both IdPs.

4. Session Management & Token Sharing

    After logging in with the primary IdP, the token (JWT or SAML assertion) should be valid across both systems.
    Ensure both IdPs recognize and accept the same token format. The primary IdP can issue tokens that the secondary IdP trusts or accepts via federation settings.

5. Implement a Custom Proxy (if required)

    As a fallback or more customized approach, create a proxy service that intermediates between the user and both IdPs.
    The proxy handles the login session, generates tokens or cookies, and forwards requests to the secondary IdP on behalf of the user.

Each of these steps can be customized based on your specific IdPs, authentication protocols, and any constraints or additional security requirements.


To enable Keycloak to share tokens or work seamlessly with a third-party IdP, you can leverage Keycloak's ability to act as a broker or an intermediary for authentication. Here’s how you can set this up:

### 1. **Set Up Keycloak as an Identity Broker**
   - Configure Keycloak to act as a broker, meaning it can accept users authenticated by a third-party IdP.
   - In Keycloak, set up the third-party IdP as an Identity Provider. You can use OpenID Connect (OIDC), SAML, or other supported protocols based on the third-party IdP's capabilities.
   - Keycloak can then handle federated login from the third-party IdP, and once the user authenticates, Keycloak will issue its own tokens (such as OAuth tokens or JWTs) based on the third-party IdP authentication.

### 2. **Configure an Identity Provider in Keycloak**
   - In the Keycloak admin console, go to **Identity Providers** and choose the provider type (e.g., OIDC or SAML).
   - Fill in the required fields, such as the client ID, client secret, authorization endpoint, and token endpoint of the third-party IdP.
   - Save and configure attribute mappings if necessary to map user data from the third-party IdP to Keycloak.

### 3. **Enable Token Exchange (Optional)**
   - If the third-party IdP supports token exchange, Keycloak can exchange tokens directly with the third-party IdP.
   - Keycloak has a feature called *Token Exchange*, which allows it to exchange tokens with trusted third parties.
   - You’ll need to enable *Token Exchange* in Keycloak and configure the third-party IdP as a trusted token issuer.
   - This approach allows users to log in with the third-party IdP, then obtain a Keycloak token for accessing resources managed by Keycloak.

### 4. **Customize Keycloak’s Issued Tokens**
   - After authenticating with the third-party IdP, Keycloak can issue tokens with claims (user attributes) that the third-party IdP provides.
   - You can configure Keycloak to customize these tokens in **Client Scopes** and **Mappers** settings, allowing fine-grained control over what is included in the issued tokens.

### 5. **Set Up Logout Synchronization (Optional)**
   - To provide a seamless logout experience, configure logout synchronization between Keycloak and the third-party IdP.
   - Keycloak can notify the third-party IdP upon logout, ensuring tokens or sessions are invalidated across both IdPs.

This setup allows users to authenticate with a third-party IdP while Keycloak manages session handling, token issuance, and authorization for applications integrated with Keycloak. This way, Keycloak effectively acts as a token mediator and identity broker.
